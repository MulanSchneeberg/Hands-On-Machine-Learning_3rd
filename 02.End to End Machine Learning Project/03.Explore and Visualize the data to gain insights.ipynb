Also, if the training set is very large, you may want to sample an exploration set, to make manipulations easy and fast during the exploration phase. In this case, the training set is quite small, so you can just work directly on the full set. Since youâ€™re going to experiment with various transformations of the full training set, you should make a copy of the original so you can revert to it afterwards"
